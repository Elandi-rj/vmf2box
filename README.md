# Input vmf get box
https://elandi-rj.github.io/vmf2box/

guide: <br>
upload/drag and drop a vmf <br>
if you want it to generate a box for every trigger_teleport, just press the box button<br>
if you don't want trigger_teleport, type what you want in the text field then press box<br>
if the result is a huge list of box commands, you will need to copy paste them into a config file e.g. box.cfg<br>
in game, you will need to bind something to the config e.g. bind r "exec box.cfg"
